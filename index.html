<h3>Active Segmentation</h3>
The Active Segmentation platform for ImageJ (ASP/IJ) was developed in the scope of GSOC 2016 - 2018. The plug-in provides a general-purpose environment that allows biologists and other domain experts to use transparently state-of-the-art techniques in machine learning to achieve excellent image segmentation.
<br>
<h3>ImageJ Software</h3>
 ImageJ is a public domain Java image processing program extensively used in life and material sciences. The program was designed with an open architecture that provides extensibility via plug-ins.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Need For Cell Tracking</h3>
Cell Tracking has gained importance recently owing to extensive research in biological domains. It has become evident that if we want to take full advantage of the potential wealth of information hidden in the data produced by cellular experiments, visual inspection, and manual analysis are no longer adequate. To ensure efficiency, consistency, and completeness in data processing and analysis, computational tools are essential. Of particular importance to many modern live-cell imaging experiments is the ability to automatically track and analyze the motion of cell objects in images recorded using time-lapse microscopy.

<h3>Project Work during GSoC Period 2020 </h3>
In this(2020) edition of Google Summer of Code, I have worked on extending the Active-Segmentation Platform to perform Cell Tracking on Segmented Stack of images. The technique employed is based on the Viterbi Algorithm, which is widely used in Digital Communications and Natural Language Processing. I would also like to acknowledge the research paper, from where I derive the foundational idea for my project, titled <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/blau/pdfs/Magnusson_Blau_2015.pdf">Global Linking Of Cell Tracks Using The Viterbi Algorithm</a> by Klas E.G Magnusson, Joakim Jalden, Penney M. Gilbert &  Helen M. Blau.<br><br> For viewing my GSoC 2020 Proposal for Incf project "Cell Tracking Using Geometrical Features" <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nuD2C-PyyeuOOdYXavlcQPecDSwTUogn/view?usp=sharing" > please click here </a> 
<br><br>
<ul>

<li>Phase 1 We worked on extraction of data from a Segmented Stack and representation of the extracted data as a model suitable for Viterbi Algorithm<br>
<br><li>Phase 2 We focused on defining a framework for the System and experimenting with Weka Classifiers for defining probabilities of Cell events. I also started with the integration of my work in Active Segmentation to further work on the GUI for Tracking.<br>
<br><li>Phase 3 Our focus shifted towards a basic use case implementation for Cell Tracking using the Viterbi Algorithm. I worked on the GUI for track display using colors and tracking migrations in a Segmented Stack.  
</ul>

<br>
We started with a single purpose repository <a href="https://github.com/Raghavendrapara/CellTracking">CellTracking</a> for backend implementation of the algorithm. Further integration and GUI developments were done inside ActiveSegmentation clone with <a href="https://github.com/Raghavendrapara/ACTIVESEGMENTATION/commits/CellTrack">my commits listed here</a> 
<br><br>
The project was approached with a divide and conquer methodology. I have listed my weekly work as a Google doc. To view the weekly progress report please <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z6vedMc3IFCEJJse9lma52jtWvInxC6Y0x3Kve2u7zk/edit?usp=sharing"> click here.</a>

<br><br><br>

We start with a image stack and develop a Trellis of states i.e. Detections/Extractions that allows modelling of the images and cells in the form of a Graph.
